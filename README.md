# Trust-Scoring-Model
Situation
Helping the client( a top-5 bank in the USA) marketing  team  benchmark its “trust index” based on social media presence.

Complication:
Quantifying an abstract idea such as Trust is a challenge. The volume of customer talk is variable between the bank and its core competitors

Key Question answered:
What are the quantifiable parameters that could serve as trust attributes? How do we benchmark US bank against its core competitors?
